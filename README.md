# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I started this project to further my knowledge of JavaScript, particlarly when it comes to the use of web API's. This project is supposed to be a timed quiz. Even though I did not finish making the entirety of the quiz (YET, I plan on coming back to this to finish it in the future), my understanding of JavaScript and APIs has significantly improved through working on this. I am confident that if I had a few more days I could have figured the rest of it out. 


## Installation

To install and run this project, simply pull it down from this repository and open it in your IDE of choice. From there go ahead and run it in your browser.

## Usage

To use this application, just click the start button and take the quiz!

I know it doesn't look pretty, I put all of my time into the JavaScript.

## Credits

Shout out to my tutor Andres Long and ssavage02 from ask BCS. They really helped me understand some concepts that I was struggling with. Andres specifically helped me make my quiz responsive, and ssavage02 from ask BCS helped me when it came to evaluating answers in the quiz.
